# When end-of-line normalization is enabled, Git subtly adjusts line
# endings as files are checked in and out. This can be a problem and
# should generally be disabled, but some flavors of Git enable it by
# default. The following line ensures that it is disabled. For more
# information, see the gitattributes documentation.
